# Spotify Stats

Spotify Stats is a tool that uses Spotify's API to display a user's top 10 songs and artists from the past month, the past 6 months, and all time. It was inspired by 'Receiptify,' a popular tool for displaying a user's Spotify statistics in a receipt format. Built using Python for the backend, the Flask framework and the 'Spotipy' library.
