            1. figuring out authorization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBycigbJQzA
                
                I began following the spotify api tutorial with node js to get the login working but none of the code worked for me 
                so I ended up switching from js to python for backend to make things more simple. With python I was able 
                to use 'spotipy' which made the entire process easier. I used this video and the official spotify developers code 
                to help with getting the access token from spotify. I also took a look at actual receiptify since its an open
                source project. 
                
                Referenced authorization code: https://github.com/katiagilligan888/Spotify-Discover-Weekly/blob/main/discoverWeekly.py
                
                ~ 5 hours, started over a few times
            
            2. Setting up: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/unfollow-artists-users 

                I created more routes in my python file to lead to an index page and options page where the songs 
                will be displayed. Both html pages, not styled yet. Also did some connecting between routes and 
                researching the spotify developers api website.

                ~ 2 hour

            3. Wrote my calls to the spotify api for the top songs.

                Spotipy makes it simple to call the top year(s), half years and 1 month top songs. However, I wanted to
                display them on the page somehow. I tried to do it without refreshing the page using ajax calls, but I 
                realized it was too complex and time consuming. So I decided to reload the page everytime a user chose 
                a different time period. I made a html template so I could change the tracks shown
                and display the users spotify username.

                ~ 3 hours

            4. Mobile styling index, about & options pages

                used box shadows, hovers, back arrows, drop-down menus

                ~ 3 hours

            5. Hosting
                
                Hid my client_id & client_secret by putting it in a .env file, made a repository on github,
                updated all contents. tried to host on github pages but found it it can only host static sites. 
                So looked for alternatives and landed on a free tier trial for AWS. But later found out it was
                way too complicated, gave up on hosting for now.

                ~1 hour

            6. Styling for larger screens & finishing mobile

                color palette:
                    Ice Cold: #a0d2eb
                    Freeze Purple: #e5eaf5
                    Medium Purple: #d0bdf4
                    Purple Pain: #8458B3
                    Heavy Purple: #a28089

                ~4 hours

            7. Accessibility changes

                index.html, options.html, about.html:             
                - wave ✅
                - axe ✅
                prefers reduced motion (for skip tab) ✅
                prefers dark/light color preferences ✅
                add skip to main content ✅

                ~1 hour
